Hi, I'm Chris 👋
Illustration of a person throwing a paper plane

I'm a coder who really likes doing crossword puzzles and climbing rocks. Currently, I am a senior at UT Austin, where I'm studying Computer Science and learning about cybersecurity. I'm the Web Development Officer for the Hispanic Association of Computer Scientists, and I help maintain our open source website. I like messing around with Javascript and CSS, and I will one day learn a thing or two about security.

💻 I'll soon be working as a Software Engineer at Microsoft!
💬 Ask me about web development, rock climbing, or sports (that's really all I do)
📪 Contact me at chrisnunes57@gmail.com

😁 Pronouns: he/him
🤯 Fun fact: I can do a New York Times Mini Crossworld puzzle in 6 seconds
